Solve those exercises before this Friday, 

Exos:

1 - write a console app that scans user name & print Hello <user-name> 

2 - write a console app that takes two numbers and apply +, /,*,^,- .... based on the users target opération.... 
Hint : use switch statement 

3 - write a console app that takes a matrix as input (of size N*N) and print it square ( ie : putting M is matrix the expected out put is : M*M )

4 - console application to deal with tables ( find max value/ find min value / order table AtoZ & ZtoA / deleting element from table / adding element to the table...)....
Alll based on the users input your console should decide which opération it should execute 

5 - console app that gets the current system time and print  ...
Good morning-> if it's 3am to 12pm
Good afternoon-> "" 12pm to 4pm
Good evening-> "" 4pm to 9pm
Good night-> "" 9pm to 3 am

6 -  crypting messages :
Message + int ---> |  console  |  ---> crypted message 

Example: 
I love java + 10 -> |  console  | ---> Svy�o}tk�k
Where:
S =(int) I + 10
v = (int) v + 10
...
And so on 

7 - console that picks a random number from the list: 
6,0,0,7,18,18,1,5

Which numbers have the highest chance of being picked ? 
How to force them to have all the same chance?
How to make the numbers with high chances to be the lowest chance and vice-versa? (Without changing the structure of your table)

 SUBMITTING 
your code should be on github
search for clean code principles and apply them
each one should try to solve the exercises alone
each team should provide doc to explain their solutions and why you think it's the best solution
